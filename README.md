# 👋 About Me
Hi, I’m @CemKarkiner

# 👀 Interests
I’m interested in the development and training of NLP models, with a particular focus on custom solutions tailored to complex and structured datasets, such as those in the legal system. I enjoy exploring new techniques to optimize model performance and efficiency, especially in areas like text classification, legal document analysis, and question-answering tasks that are relevant to legal frameworks.

# 🌱 Current Learning
I’m currently learning about Transformer-based models, such as custom implementations of attention mechanisms and self-attention layers. I’m diving deep into the intricacies of training these models from scratch, focusing on architecture design, hyperparameter tuning, and improving generalization. My goal is to integrate advanced NLP models into practical use cases within the legal domain, including text mining, legal document classification, case law analysis, and legal text processing.

# 💻 What I'm Currently Working On
Right now, I’m focused on implementing and fine-tuning a custom Transformer model for NLP tasks, specifically for the legal system. I’m working on applying it to real-world legal datasets, where I’m handling tasks such as document classification, case law analysis, and semantic search for legal texts. Additionally, I am building a framework for improving model efficiency and scalability while maintaining accuracy and interpretability in legal applications.

# 💞️ Collaboration Interests
I’m looking to collaborate on NLP projects that involve training models on specialized legal datasets, particularly for tasks such as legal document classification, case prediction, legal question-answering, or semantic search in the legal context. I’m also interested in exploring new ways to integrate Transformer models into legal AI applications. If you're working on a project related to legal systems or need expertise in custom model training and dataset preparation for legal texts, feel free to reach out!
