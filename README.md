# 👋 About Me
Hi, I’m @CemKarkiner

# 👀 Interests
I’m interested in the development and training of NLP models, with a particular focus on custom solutions tailored to complex and structured datasets, like those used in legal case analysis. I enjoy exploring new techniques to optimize model performance and efficiency, especially in areas like text classification, sequence labeling, and question-answering tasks.

# 🌱 Current Learning
I’m currently learning about Transformer-based models, such as custom implementations of attention mechanisms and self-attention layers. I’m diving deep into the intricacies of training these models from scratch, focusing on architecture design, hyperparameter tuning, and improving generalization. My goal is to integrate advanced NLP models into practical use cases, including text mining, document classification, and legal text processing.

# 💞️ Collaboration Interests
I’m looking to collaborate on NLP projects that involve training models on specialized datasets, particularly for tasks such as document classification, term frequency analysis, or semantic search. I’m also interested in exploring new ways to integrate Transformer models into real-world applications and creating datasets that can enhance model performance in different domains. If you're working on a project that needs expertise in custom model training or dataset preparation, feel free to reach out!
